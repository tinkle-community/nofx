## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added - Major Architecture Transformation ðŸš€

**Complete System Redesign - Web-Based Configuration Platform**

This is a **major breaking update** that completely transforms NOFX from a static config-based system to a modern web-based trading platform.

#### Database-Driven Architecture
- SQLite integration replacing static JSON config
- Persistent storage with automatic timestamps
- Foreign key relationships and triggers for data consistency
- Separate tables for AI models, exchanges, traders, and system config

#### Web-Based Configuration Interface
- Complete web-based configuration management (no more JSON editing)
- AI Model setup through web interface (DeepSeek/Qwen API keys)
- Exchange management (Binance/Hyperliquid credentials)
- Dynamic trader creation (combine any AI model with any exchange)
- Real-time control (start/stop traders without system restart)

#### Flexible Architecture
- Separation of concerns (AI models and exchanges independent)
- Mix & match capability (unlimited combinations)
- Scalable design (support for unlimited traders)
- Clean slate approach (no default traders)

#### Enhanced API Layer
- RESTful design with complete CRUD operations
- New endpoints:
  - `GET/PUT /api/models` - AI model configuration
  - `GET/PUT /api/exchanges` - Exchange configuration
  - `POST/DELETE /api/traders` - Trader management
  - `POST /api/traders/:id/start|stop` - Trader control
- Updated documentation for all API endpoints

#### Modernized Codebase
- Type safety with proper separation of configuration types
- Database abstraction with prepared statements
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Better code organization (database, API, business logic)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Old `config.json` files no longer used
- Configuration must be done through web interface
- Much easier setup and better UX
- No more server restarts for configuration changes

### Why This Matters
- ðŸŽ¯ **User Experience**: Much easier to configure and manage
- ðŸ”§ **Flexibility**: Create any combination of AI models and exchanges
- ðŸ“Š **Scalability**: Support for complex multi-trader setups
- ðŸ”’ **Reliability**: Database ensures data persistence and consistency
- ðŸš€ **Future-Proof**: Foundation for advanced features

## [2.0.2] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed - Critical Bug Fixes: Trade History & Performance Analysis

#### PnL Calculation - Major Error Fixed
- **Fixed**: PnL now calculated as actual USDT amount instead of percentage only
- Previously ignored position size and leverage (e.g., 100 USDT @ 5% = 1000 USDT @ 5%)
- Now: `PnL (USDT) = Position Value Ã— Price Change % Ã— Leverage`
- Impact: Win rate, profit factor, and Sharpe ratio now accurate

#### Position Tracking - Missing Critical Data
- **Fixed**: Open position records now store quantity and leverage
- Previously only stored price and time
- Essential for accurate PnL calculations

#### Position Key Logic - Long/Short Conflict
- **Fixed**: Changed from `symbol` to `symbol_side` format
- Now properly distinguishes between long and short positions
- Example: `BTCUSDT_long` vs `BTCUSDT_short`

#### Sharpe Ratio Calculation - Code Optimization
- **Changed**: Replaced custom Newton's method with `math.Sqrt`
- More reliable, maintainable, and efficient

### Why This Matters
- Historical trade statistics now show real USDT profit/loss
- Performance comparison between different leverage trades is accurate
- AI self-learning mechanism receives correct feedback
- Multi-position tracking (long + short simultaneously) works correctly

---

## [2.0.2] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed - Aster Exchange Precision Error

- Fixed Aster exchange precision error (code -1111)
- Improved price and quantity formatting to match exchange requirements
- Added detailed precision processing logs for debugging
- Enhanced all order functions with proper precision handling

#### Technical Details
- Added `formatFloatWithPrecision` function
- Price and quantity formatted according to exchange specifications
- Trailing zeros removed to optimize API requests

---

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed - ComparisonChart Data Processing
